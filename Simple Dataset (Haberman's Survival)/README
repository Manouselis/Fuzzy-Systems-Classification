This is an experimental application developed as part of the course "Fuzzy Systems" assignment, that took place in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2019.

The goal is to find the best model parameters to classify the samples of the Avila dataset. To this end 5 models were initialized by genifs2 and tested, where:

*Task Model 1 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 1.00) => NumberOfRules = 4.
*Task Model 2 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 0.80) => NumberOfRules = 5.
*Task Model 3 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 0.71) => NumberOfRules = 7.
*Task Model 4 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 0.60) => NumberOfRules = 9.
*Task Model 5 -> (Squash Factor = 0.5 | radii = 0.40) => NumberOfRules = 11
