# Simple Dataset #
The goal is to find the best model parameters to classify the samples of the Dataset.

### Class Independent Models ###
* Task Model 1
    * radii = 0.15 
    * Number Of Rules = 88.
* Task Model 2 
    * radii = 0.85 
    * Number Of Rules = 2. 

### Class Dependent Models ###

* Task Model 3
    * radii = 0.15 
    * Number Of Rules = 97. 
* Task Model 4 
    * radii = 0.85 
    * Number Of Rules = 3.
